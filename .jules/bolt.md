# BOLT'S JOURNAL - CRITICAL LEARNINGS ONLY

This journal is NOT a log - only add entries for CRITICAL learnings that will help me avoid mistakes or make better decisions.

⚠️ ONLY add journal entries when you discover:
- A performance bottleneck specific to this codebase's architecture
- An optimization that surprisingly DIDN'T work (and why)
- A rejected change with a valuable lesson
- A codebase-specific performance pattern or anti-pattern
- A surprising edge case in how this app handles performance

Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD - [Title]
**Learning:** [Insight]
**Action:** [How to apply next time]`
